There are two containers of volume ‘a’ and ‘b’ litres such that ‘a’ < ‘b’ without any measurement markings.

 

Objective is to measure a given volume of water ‘q’ such that ‘q’ < ‘b’.

 

There is unlimited supply of water and one can:

 

a)       Fill a container

b)      Empty a container

c)       Pour water from one container to another till one of it is full or gets empty

 

Find the minimum number of steps needed to get the required volume ‘q’ and also print out the steps to reach the volume ‘q’.

 

If a solution cannot be arrived at, print ‘NOT POSSIBLE’.

 

For eg:

 

Input: 3,5,4 (given containers of volume 3 and 5 litre measure 4 litres)

Output:

6:(0,0)->(0,5)->(3,2)->(0,2)->(2,0)->(2,5)->(3,4)

 

Input: 10,5,3

Output:

NOT POSSIBLE
